		<description>Oh I am so happy that Shutter exists - I couldn&#039;t do without that tool. I was using ScreenshotCaptor while on Windows and it was so difficult to find something similar on Linux. As I do a lot of screenshots for documentation or along with user support, an efficient screenshot tool that allows to do annotations and the like is essential for me.

Thanks so much!</description>
