Thanks for the clarification. Didn&#039;t think of checking in the preferences. I think it would be a bit more intuitive to have an icon on the tool bar for this feature. And a quick way to enable and disable time delay instead of opening preferences dialog each time to do so.</description>

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-1900&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Laf&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful tool in a similar league as SnagIT. I have been using it to capture screenshots and I have been able to save time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suggestion – You should add a feature to take screenshots after a duration of time. This is a must have feature for any screen capture tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SnagIT allows you to use a timer to take a screenshot of an area on your screen after a duration of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see this feature in the next version of shutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shutter&#039;s delay functionality works a little bit different from other screenshot tools. It works like this (selection mode in this example):
1) Set up a delay
http://www.ubuntu-pics.de/bild/10892/shutter___preferences_VJrw3S.png
2) Start selection tool and select a screen region
------Now the delay takes place-------
3) Now i can do anything i want, e.g. opening a menu or move the mouse cursor to the perfect position
------delay finished----------------
4) capture

This behavior is discussed here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/shutter/+bug/341315

&lt;p&gt;Also looking forward to see a plugin for cropping images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is already there. You can use the built-in editor to crop the screenshot (see the feature description in the blog post above).</description>

Snarky attitude, lack of demand and need. I&#039;m sure I can name a window capture app that doesn&#039;t have this, and there have been only 2-3 requests for it in Shutter.

What&#039;s taking so long? More useful things that are done in free time. This&#039;ll definitely be added, but your comment obviously didn&#039;t speed that up any. Not sure of what effect were you trying to achieve there.</description>

		<description>Sorry, but this program is of very little use. There is no way to auto-scroll with this application (capture the portion of the screen that&#039;s not visible). That specific feature is basic to a screen capture utility. An application without it is virtually useless. All Windows screen capture utilities have had that function for years. Even the tiny Firefox extension, Screengrab!, has that function. Yet there is not a single screen capture utility for Linux that can do this. What&#039;s taking so long? This should be priority number one.</description>

		<description>This is an amazing piece of software. My congratulations for all your hard work. 

Using a normal screenshot application I didn&#039;t use much, but with Shutter I have been emailing and saving screenshots regularly for various reasons. Something that was not much use to me, now thanks to your hard work, is now useful.

I have subscribed to the PPA and this latest update is excellent. Again, well done.

Can you please push for this to be made default in Ubuntu.</description>

		<description>Kick ass !
I love Shutter !
The use of native icons is something pretty cool.
And I LOVE the fact that I don&#039;t need to re-select the censor tool after each use of it ! 


Amazing job. I love it.</description>
