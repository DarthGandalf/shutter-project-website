`shutter --full` starts Shutter with the last saved settings and takes a full screen screenshot to the directory you&#039;ve configured in the Shutter&#039;s preferences.
This command could be easily used in a shell script for example - with a `sleep` command to get the desired delay working. 
But, to be honest, I don&#039;t know if Shutter is the best application to do this. You could also use import or scrot in shell scripts.</description>

		<description>Hi!

Firstly, thank you for this great application that could be used in infinite ways.

Secondly, I have a question: how could I make it take a regular screenshot and save it in a certain folder. I would like to make it take a screenshot of the full screen at each 10 minutes and save it in a certain folder.

God bless us all!

Hm, I&#039;ve nearly the same system / configuration and everything works fine. Could you please try to produce a screenshot of the error and paste the complete error message here?
It might also be useful to launch Shutter via terminal, enable the debug mode and paste the output here as well. Of course, you can also open a new bug at launchpad.net to avoid cluttering the comment section:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/shutter

Thanks for your help and patience.

		<description>I love Shutter to pieces. I&#039;m only gutted that half of the plugins don&#039;t work for me. I get unspecified error. Makes creating screenshots for my blog take a little longer than i want because i have to fire up the Gimp to twist them in 3D space or turn them polaroid style..</description>

Hi,
I can tell you how I use Zoomit during a presentation: Zoomit runs in the background with a symbol in the tray just like Shutter.
If someone asks about a point on a slide, I quickly press Ctrl-2, Zoomit takes a screenshot of the whole screen and immideately views it full screen.
I can now draw freehand on the presentation with the mouse, draw rectangles with Shift+mouse, add text after pressing shortcut &quot;t&quot;, switch drawing/text color to red with &quot;r&quot;, blue with &quot;b&quot; etc. Since I work on the screenshot it looks to the audience as I work on the presentation itself. If I press &quot;w&quot; the whole screen is white, &quot;k&quot; black. If I want to zoom in on a detail in the screenshot I use the mouse wheel. Change the line width with shift+mouse wheel. When the audience is happy I can press ESC to go back to the presentation, or save the annotated screenshot with Ctrl-s. Feature wise shutter seems very close to be able to do these tricks, except the ability to edit the screenshot in full screen mode with no menus :)
thanks again for a great tool,
Helge</description>

No, that&#039;s not possible in the newer versions. But we are planning to implement a customizable toolbar (I can&#039;t promise any date when this will be finished):

		<description>Thank you very much for this tool! I&#039;m using it on a daily basis. The possibilities for editing are really useful. I&#039;m just missing the possibility (which had been in Gscrot) to add a symbol for my two most used plugins in the toolbar. Or did I miss something?</description>

What kind of keyboard shortcuts do you mean? I don&#039;t know &quot;zoomit&quot; but I&#039;ll have a look at it. Thanks for your suggestion.</description>

I totally agree, but I think we have to wait until effects are supported by cairo (the drawing tool is based on it) to implement a &quot;pixelate&quot; effect, see:

		<description>Great program! I love it. Very useful. Thank you.

I have a wish though :). In the editor, for &quot;censor mode&quot;, I suggest to add a possibility to censor rectangular area. Sometimes it is necessary to &quot;hide&quot; a block of the picture. Also, censored portions could optionally have a &quot;pixelated&quot; view, like this: https://url.odesk.com/ui9zb - that way it is more clear that it was censored. Of course, small censored parts are fine as they are now.

Best regards,
Dmitry.</description>
