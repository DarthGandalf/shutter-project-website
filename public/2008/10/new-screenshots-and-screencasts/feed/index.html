		<description>Hi!
first congratulations for this appreciated app! its very useful!
them I really want to contribute to this project. since I cant code, maybe I can help translating to European Portuguese. but I need to figure how to do this...
I want also give you one suggestion: integrate some ocr functionality like this

&quot;Screenshot Reader is an easy-to-use utility that lets you quickly capture screen images and allows you to perform “instant” OCR from the screen. It is ideal for pulling text, tables, or images from Web browser pages, flash presentations, Windows Explorer file menus, or error messages. Screenshot Reader is also an ideal “quick OCR” tool when you want to pull small quotes or a few sentences of text from a PDF or image file.&quot;
