Currently there is no such way. We are going to rewrite the uploading stuff for Shutter 0.88, so maybe there will be something like this in the future:

		<description><![CDATA[I have been using Shutter for capturing screenshots and creating tutorials for my websites. I would like to extend the feature of Shutter by adding photobucket the problem is that I am not so much familiar with Perl Programming. You have used Perl for adding the hosting sites for uploads.

But I am familiar with Python and Java, Is there anyway that I can integrate my Python code to your application and extend the features of Shutter especially the upload hosting sites.

with best regards,

		<description><![CDATA[Currently there is no way of adding a new hosting-site manually because the upload funtionality needs to be implemented for every single hosting-site. Maybe this will change in the future.

Do you have any special hosting-site you would like to see in GScrot?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. There will hopefully be a photobucket upload as well, but we have currently only one developer ( me ;-) ) and this will definitely take some time. 

Just stay tuned...]]></description>

I&#039;ll put it on the list for 0.64 (0.63 will be released in the next days).]]></description>
