		<description>Thank you for your bug reports, Edwood. I&#039;ll comment on them later after some testing.

There aren&#039;t any additional plugins available yet, because the project is pretty young. Maybe we should add a plugin section to the homepage where we can offer plugins, you are right.
I&#039;ll even try to write a little tutorial of writing plugins but i am quite busy at the moment.
Would you please send me your plugin so i can put it on the homepage when everything is set up? 

Greetings

		<description>Hi!

On Xubuntu Intrepid:

1.  new 0.63 version did not recognized sessions created with 0.62.
2.  after &#039;ENTER&#039; is pressed for a selected region capture, the captured image does not show in gscrot window and it does not allows to upload it from the filesystem using &#039;File &gt; Open&#039;

I tried to post this in Launchpad &#039;Bugs&#039; section but I did not find how.  

I also created a new bash-plugin based on torned paper example in http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/thumbnails/#torn.

A contributed plugin section would be good for users.

Thank you.</description>
