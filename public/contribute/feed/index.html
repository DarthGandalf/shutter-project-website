		<description><![CDATA[Could you remove Twitpic of your list of providers, please.
Because:
Twitpic is shutting down
Posted on September 4, 2014 by Noah
UPDATE: It’s with a heavy heart that I announce again that Twitpic will be shutting down on October 25th. We worked through a handful of potential acquirers and exhausted all potential options. We were almost certain we had found a new home for Twitpic (hence our previous tweet), but agreeable terms could not be met. Normally we wouldn’t announce something like that prematurely but we were hoping to let our users know as soon as possible that Twitpic was living on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi always Patrick,
I have try this command in terminal:
patrinux@patrinux-ordi ~ $ xdg-email --attach &#039;/home/patrinux/Images/Captures/2016-01-30-14:28:44.jpg&#039;
and Thunderbird run very well!

But not your command:
patrinux@patrinux-ordi ~ $ xdg-email --attach &#039;file:///home/patrinux/Images/Captures/2016-01-30-14:28:44.jpg&#039;

The terminal answer this:
patrinux@patrinux-ordi ~ $ shutter
xdg-email: file &#039;file:///home/patrinux/Images/Captures/2016-01-30-14:28:44.jpg&#039; does not exist]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the info about the size of the selection.

However, I would find it useful if I could fix the size of the selection window in pixels, e.g. 400x400, and be able to move this around the screen to select a section of the screen as a standard size.

I realize I can do this with the selection menu, entering the required size and then moving the selection around with the up/down widgets. But it would be nice if the selection window menu could remember the last x/y dimension used and I could move the selection with the mouse and fine tune it with the selection menu.

Why do I want this ?. To make it easier to select images of a standard size for use on a web site.

I have only used a few times, but I can see you have a useful application here, and as someone posted earlier, this means I can shift selection of images from my iMac to my Linux system. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[here is a link to Snagit: http://www.techsmith.com/snagit/ I guess there is a free trial available. Software is divided into two parts; 1) capture tool and 2) Editor. The editor is really powerful. It also comes with history and libary functionality. Try it out and you will get an idea of what I mean. (only MAC and Windows). 
I hope that Shutter is on its way to beat Snagit...]]></description>
