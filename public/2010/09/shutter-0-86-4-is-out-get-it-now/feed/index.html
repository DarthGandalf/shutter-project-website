		<description><![CDATA[this screenshot tool is awesome, i love it.
the capture all workspaces feature is great.
if i had just one suggestion, it would be the possibility to choose only some of your workspaces to capture. 
you would tick which f your workspaces to capture, and id will capture just the wanted ones. (and an option to tile them, chosing the number of rows/columns).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are official packages for Debian: /downloads/third-party-packages/

They are pretty much out-of-date, but you can also download the latest source package. Shutter is written in Perl so you don&#039;t have to compile anything. I would recommend installing the official packages first in order to install the majority of Shutter&#039;s dependencies automatically. 
Please let me know if you need any further assistance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am glad you like Shutter.

The first thing is already fixed in trunk and will be part of the upcoming release (0.87):
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/388478
Using the built-in drawing tool directly is not possible yet and I am not working on it. There is too much work that is more important currently. If someone else wants to do it, I am willing to help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great app! One small but powerful feature I miss though is the ability to display a web url for one&#039;s own ftp upload.

It would just require one more config setting per ftp account - the base url.

The tool should then after the upload show/copy to clipboard the full www url (base url+image name) in the same fashion as with e.g. imagehack upload services.

And - of course - 1-click-export to the prefered service/location would be nice :-)]]></description>
