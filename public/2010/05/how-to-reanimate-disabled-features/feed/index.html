		<description><![CDATA[Dear Romario,

Awesome post man. I had to search for quite a long to get to this post. It was just the thing I needed for my Linux Mint 17.1 (Rebecca). Big thanks to you.

Now I can edit screenshots. Any idea how to do screencast using shutter?

Thanks,
Raiyeekm]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the helpful post.

Btw, why the standard packages don&#039;t ship with these dependencies as required by default instead of recommended?

It&#039;s a low overhead for a much nicer user experience, no?

I&#039;ve just had this same problem on Linux Mint 17.1 -- installing the packages solved the issue.]]></description>
