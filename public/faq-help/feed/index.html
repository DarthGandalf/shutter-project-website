		<description><![CDATA[David you&#039;ve probably already figured this one out on your own but just in case and for anyone left scratching their heads I&#039;ll write this long reply X)

I got the same, first (like you most likely have tried already) I did the following in a terminal window or similar:
sudo apt-get install gnome-web-photo
then a little later I noticed something so I made sure to quit Shutter because by default (this can be changed in preferences) it had only closed the window and left an active task bar status icon. When I started Shutter again it had found the gnome-web-photo :)

It now works but there are still some separate issues in gnome-web-photo itself which means there is trouble with some parts of webpages, usually comments. Something similar is mentioned in their TODO at https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-web-photo/blob/master/TODO

If anyone can help them please have a look at their git repository:
https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-web-photo

Although I&#039;m afraid it might be yet another level down and that the fix is needed in the webkitgtk that gnome-web-photo uses...

If it&#039;s any consolation not even the internal Mozilla err... I mean FireFox webpage screenshot thing that is launched using their browser console (or whatever it was) ...not even that manages (or managed some months ago) to truly make copies of what you actually see in their very own window on your screen ...if it even works at all which it didn&#039;t always. That&#039;s almost unbelievable lol but it&#039;s my own experience. No third party stuff I&#039;ve tried does a &quot;perfect&quot; job either and most of those simply die if you feed them really large webpages. So if it&#039;s really important to get everything included one is back to stitching together ordinary screenshots manually. Pretty aggravating stuff :3

Maybe other browsers are better at it than FF. The more advanced HTML and/or CSS, scripts, content servers etc. there are the worse it gets.

Another separate thing I would like to mention since I&#039;m making a comment (or more like &quot;writing a novel&quot;) is that all the very very cool Shutter effects one can use on a screenshot are &quot;hidden away&quot; in the menu and choice &quot;Screenshot &#124; Run a plugin...&quot; and this doesn&#039;t have its own icon or anything on the toolbar, also one can edit a screenshot many times both before or after using as many plugins as you like!

As an example I&#039;ve just made a cool shot of some terminal content (no frame » Preferences) that is both custom 3D rotated to almost balance on a corner, and 3D mirrored (chose the same background color and/or transparency to remove annoying transparent line that&#039;s there despite 0 offset), cropped (select what you want to keep), and then first greyscaled before finally using the sepia plugin :)

Too bad I didn&#039;t censor the content first or I would have shared ...it was just a test :D]]></description>
